all chaotic

1.Increasing the length of data set can remarkably enhance the accuracy, but also increase the calculations.
So we can adjust the sampling frequency to reduce computation while ensure accuracy.
2.Use parallel loop and gpuArray to speed up. It is strongly recommended when you have a large-size array 
and nested loops to run.
3.The correlation dimensions of chaotic cases are more likely to be much higher than others.


1.kernel and filter
2.fourier transform
3.nmse and error rate
4.adjust # of pdms according to ein, to avoid overfitting or underfitting
